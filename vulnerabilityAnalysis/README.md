# VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
OBJECTIVES:
1. perform vulnerability research with vulnerability scoring systems and databases. i.e, CWE, CVE, NVD.
2. Perform vulnerability assesment using various tools.
## USING VULNERABILITY DATABASES
### 1. CWE
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. <br>
```https://cwe.mitre.org/```
### 2. CVE
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. <br>
```https://cve.mitre.org/```
### 3. NVD
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). <br>
```https://nvd.nist.gov/```
## USING VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT TOOLS

### 1. OpenVAS
Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any vulnerability test. <br>

### 2. Nessus
 It performs vulnerability, configuration, and compliance assessment. It supports various technologies such as OSes, network devices, hypervisors, databases, tablets/phones, web servers, and critical infrastructure. <br>
 
### 3. GFI LanGuard
It scans the network and ports to detect, assess, and correct security vulnerabilities, with minimal administrative effort. It scans your OSes, virtual environments, and installed applications through vulnerability check databases. <br>

### 4. Nikto
performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files and HTTP server options
