# Static Analysis

## Perform online malware scanning using Online tools
VirusTotal is an online platform used to scan any file on various antvirus and malware detection tools.<br>
sample VT report:<br>

some other online tools like Hybrid analysis, cockoo sandbox etc are also widely used


## Perform a strings search using BinText
All executables contain some strings. these strings can be extracted and queried with existing databases to search for any matches using tools like BinText

* Identify packing and obfuscation methods using PEid
* Find the portable executable (PE) information of a malware executable file using PE Explorer
* Identify file dependencies using Dependency Walker
* Perform malware disassembly using IDA and OllyDbg

## Detect obfuscation and packaging using PEid
PEid is a free tool that provides details about Windows executable files. It can identify signatures associated with over 600 different packers and compilers. This tool also displays the type of packer used in packing a program. <br>
Other packaging tools like Macro_Pack and UPX can also be used. <br>

## Find the portable excutable (PE) information using PE Explorer
The PE stores metadata about the program, which helps in finding additional details of the file.<br>
PE Explorer lets you open, view, and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows executable file types (also called PE files) ranging from common such as EXE, DLL, and ActiveX Controls to less familiar types such as SCR (Screensavers), CPL (Control Panel Applets), SYS, MSSTYLES, BPL, DPL, and more. <br>

## Identifying dependencies using dependency walker
The Dependency Walker tool lists all dependent modules of an executable file and builds hierarchical tree diagrams. It also records all functions that each module exports and calls.<br>

## Malware Disassembly
Based on the reconstructed assembly code, you can inspect the program logic and recognize its threat potential. This process uses debugging tools such as IDA Pro and OllyDbg.<br>
