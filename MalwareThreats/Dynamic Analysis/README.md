# Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves executing malware code to learn how it interacts with the host system and its impact after infecting the system.<br>
To perform Dynamic analysis, the following is needed to be done: <br>
* <b>System Baselining</b>: System baselining includes capturing the system's state (snapshot) before running the malware in the sandboxed environment.
* <b>Host Integrity Monitoring</b>: Host integrity monitoring includes monitoring the state of the system and studying the changes that take place in the system and capturing the state of the system again. <br>
  ### Host integrity monitoring includes:
    * <b>Port monitoring</b>: tools like TCPView and CurrPorts can be used to monitor the TCP and UDP ports on a system. CurrPorts also automatically marks suspicious TCP/UDP ports owned by unidentified applications. CurrPorts allows you to close unwanted TCP connections, kill the process that opened the ports
    * <b>Process monitoring</b>: Process Monitor is a monitoring tool for Windows that shows the real-time file system, Registry, and process and thread activity.
    * <b>Registry monitoring</b>: Registry monitoring tools such as Regshot and jv16 PowerTools provide a simple way to perform the interesting task of tracking registry modifications. Regshot is used to compare your registry at two separate points by taking snapshots of the registry. PowerTools cleans out unneeded files and data, cleaning windows registry etc.  jv16 helps in detecting registry entries created by malware.
    * <b>Windows services monitoring</b>: SrvMan can detect changes in services and scan for suspicious Windows services. SrvMan has both GUI and Command-line modes. It can also be used to run arbitrary Win32 applications as services
    * <b>Startup program monitoring</b>: Tools like Autoruns and WinPatrol can be used to identify programs that are being run during system bootup or login, and hence be used to detect any suspicious activity in the system.
    * **Event logs monitoring and analysis**
    * **Installation monitoring**: Mirekusoft Install Monitor automatically monitors what gets placed on your system and allows you to uninstall it completely.
    * **Files and folder monitoring**: folder monitoring tools such as PA File Sight to detect any malware installed and any system file modifications. It also detects ransomware attacks coming from a network and stops them. 
    * **Device driver monitoring**: One can scan for suspicious device drivers using tools such as DriverView and Driver Reviver that verify if they are genuine and downloaded from the publisherâ€™s original site.
    * **Network traffic monitoring and analysis**
    * **DNS moniroting**: DNSQuerySniffer is a network sniffer utility that shows the DNS queries sent on your system. For every DNS query, the following information is displayed: Host Name, Port Number, Query ID, Request Type (A, AAAA, NS, MX, and other types), Request Time, Response Time, Duration, Response Code, Number of records, and the content of the returned DNS records.
    * **API calls monitoring**
