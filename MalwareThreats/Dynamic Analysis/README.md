# Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves executing malware code to learn how it interacts with the host system and its impact after infecting the system.<br>
To perform Dynamic analysis, the following is needed to be done: <br>
* <b>System Baselining</b>: System baselining includes capturing the system's state (snapshot) before running the malware in the sandboxed environment.
* <b>Host Integrity Monitoring</b>: Host integrity monitoring includes monitoring the state of the system and studying the changes that take place in the system and capturing the state of the system again. <br>
  Host integrity monitoring includes:
    * <b>Port monitoring</b>: tools like TCPView and CurrPorts can be used to monitor the TCP and UDP ports on a system. CurrPorts also automatically marks suspicious TCP/UDP ports owned by unidentified applications. CurrPorts allows you to close unwanted TCP connections, kill the process that opened the ports
    * <b>Process monitoring</b>: Process Monitor is a monitoring tool for Windows that shows the real-time file system, Registry, and process and thread activity.
    * <b>Registry monitoring</b>:
    * Windows services monitoring
    * Startup program monitoring
    * Event logs monitoring and analysis
    * Installation monitoring
    * Files and folder monitoring
    * Device driver monitoring
    * Network traffic monitoring and analysis
    * DNS moniroting
    * API calls monitoring
