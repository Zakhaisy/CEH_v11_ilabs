# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Privilege escalation is required when you want to access system resources that you are not authorized to access. It takes place in two forms: vertical privilege escalation and horizontal privilege escalation. <br>
* Horizontal Privilege Escalation: An unauthorized user tries to access the resources, functions, and other privileges that belong to an authorized user who has similar access permissions
* Vertical Privilege Escalation: An unauthorized user tries to gain access to the resources and functions of a user with higher privileges such as an application or site administrator
